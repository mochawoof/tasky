# Why?
- tasky comes as a single batchfile, making it very portable.
- It has a simple command-based interface.
- It's useful for if task manager won't work, such as if it's corrupted or blocked by your organization.
- Being a batch file, it's easy on resources and doesn't have any dependencies.

# How do I install it?
Just download the `tasky.bat` batchfile from the main repository.

# What about Linux?
Bash support might come later. If you want to port it feel free to contribute!

# I want to contribute!
The GitHub repo is open for changes, with a few rules:
- Don't add any outside dependencies.
- If you want to make changes to both an info file (including the website) and the program, please do so in separate pull requests.
