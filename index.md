# why?
Better than TaskPro
- tasky aims to fix some of TaskPro's issues:
- High load times: tasky launches almost instantly, as opposed to TaskPro's few seconds at least.
- Unintuitive UI: tasky presents a simple command-based interface instead of a clunky GUI.
- Just easier: tasky comes as a single file, making it way more portable than TaskPro.
